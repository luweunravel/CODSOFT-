CODSOFT Data Science Internship

Overview:
This repository contains the work I completed during my data science internship at CodSoft. The internship required the completion of three tasks, each focused on different data science and machine learning concepts.

Completed Tasks

Task 1: Titanic Survival Prediction

Description: I built a model to predict whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not using the Titanic dataset.

Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/titanic-dataset

Skills Demonstrated: Data cleaning, feature engineering, logistic regression, evaluation metrics.




Task 2: Movie Rating Prediction

Description: I developed a regression model that predicts movie ratings based on features like genre, director, and actors.

Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adrianmcmahon/imdb-india-movies

Skills Demonstrated: Regression analysis, feature selection, model evaluation.




Task 3: Iris Flower Classification

Description: I trained a classification model using the Iris dataset to classify iris flowers into different species based on their sepal and petal measurements.

Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arshid/iris-flower-dataset/data

Skills Demonstrated: Data preprocessing, classification techniques, model accuracy testing.
